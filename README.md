# Sandfall

Sandfall is a falling sand simulation with a twist. Why constrain your world to just one browser window when you can have multiple!

### Interacting with it

Click & drag your mouse across the page to create sand particles. 
Duplicate Sandfall on any number of browser windows and move these windows around and see the magic.

### Things to note

- Behaviour isn't entirely accurate but good enough that you shouldn't notice any oddities.
- Hacked this so the code quality isn't the best - sorry! Might fix it up or not.
